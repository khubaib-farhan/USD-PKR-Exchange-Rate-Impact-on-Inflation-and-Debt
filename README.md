# USD-PKR-Exchange-Rate-Impact-on-Inflation-and-Debt

This project involves the analysis of exchange rates, inflation rates, and central government debt for Pakistan from 1970 to 2022. The analysis includes scatter plots, linear regression models, and a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between these economic indicators.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
